[{"comment_ID": "l1baudk", "comment_Body": "> My question is do you have to be on-call as a Data Engineer?\n\nDepends on:\n\n1. The company tech organization: are \"devops admins\" going to support your production environment or do you have to do it yourself?\n2. Is your data served to external clients?: if your clients are the nearby team, you can just chat with them if there's an issue and you can probably solve it after the weekend. But if it appears in a client app over the weekend, you'll probably have to support it on weekend to avoid customer backslash.\n3. What your contract mentions.\n\nMost of my jobs, I didn't have to do that, but currently I have to and I hate it.\n\nI think you can quite easily ask those questions during the interviews and decide if the cost/benefit is good for you.
