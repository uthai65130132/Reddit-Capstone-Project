If you want to use your kitchen, you have to fold up the bed and pull out the stove, but then you try to go to the bathroom so you have to drop your stove into the floor and lower the toilet from the ceiling.\n\nTechnically it works, but you are expecting the same space to perform multiple jobs when each should have their own. Imagine you really have to take a shit, but there's something cooking in the oven so you have to wait until it's done before you can stow the stove to use the toilet, otherwise you might ruin dinner or start a fire.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nYour transactional database is doing a lot of work managing those transactions coming in, between the CrUD operations, it's juggling all of the indexes, which have to be rebuilt every time a record is changed.\n\nWhen you try to read from it as well, especially constantly for something like a dashboard, you end up with bad performance as data in and data out fight for priority -- in extreme cases, you can chew up all of the memory and freeze everything out, especially if you have a very cheap setup and are not good at writing hyper efficient queries (No, I'm not bitter about my old employer's database).\n\nAnything that interferes with a transactional database should be extremely concerning -- missed inventory events, trades, sales, etc can be a nightmare to fix.\n\nA data warehouse reduces this load by quickly extracting data at low points, and focusing on speed and efficiency above all else. Because of this, there is bandwidth available for making the data cleaner and more lightweight and closer to what you need in your final reports. Not only that, if you have 10-100-1000 users running reports, they are all pulling from the dedicated data warehouse That is tuned to handle that load and isn't competing with constantly shifting indexes and processing all of the other transactions taking place across a huge number of tables.\n\nA data mart is just a stupid industry term for a view or stored procedure or table or some other form of curated final dataset. The data being served here already has all calculations, aggregations, and joins done so the reporting system that uses it doesn't have to do much work.\n\nThe point is, rather than straining your production database which could be catastrophic (and expensive), you spread the work out to an analytical database with a much lower overhead.", "comment_Score": 4, "comment_Author": "MakeoutPoint", "comment_Link_id": "1ccfe3q", "Create Date": "2024-04-25 02:25:26+00:00"}, {"comment_ID": "l155j8z", "comment_Body": "Bro didn't read the post \ud83e\udd23", "comment_Score": 1, "comment_Author": "IAMHideoKojimaAMA", "comment_Link_id": "1ccd1ep", "Create Date": "2024-04-25 02:20:34+00:00"}, {"comment_ID": "l1552sz", "comment_Body": "I mean isn\u2019t chatgpt just trained on a bunch of semi-competent blogs you wish were bullet points?
