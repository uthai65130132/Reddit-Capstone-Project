If they are analytical queries (e.g. group by, window functions), then using a data processing system that is optimized for those type of query patterns would be more cost effective. SQL Server is a transactional processing system (OLTP) designed for fast data inserts and data updates (CRUD operations), whereas systems like Databricks or Synapse is an OLAP system that supports data partition pruning and data storage using columar-oriented format.\n\nRunning a `select sum(total_sale), country as sales group by country where order_date = '2024-01-01'` can be a very expensive query to run on a transactional database table as it requires you to scan all rows and all columns to get the answer. Whereas on an OLAP system, the `where` clause is a filter predicate that would result in data partition pruning, so only relevant rows will be scanned. And also because of the columnar file format, only selected columns will be scanned and used to provide the answer.\n\nSecond, a lakehouse architecture is designed for you to plug in your own compute to query the dataset files stored on a cloud filesystem (e.g. s3 bucket, data lake filesystem). So if you wanted to, you could have your machine learning workloads running on CPU or GPU optimized compute directly read files that are stored in the data lake filesystem as delta/iceberg/hudi/parquet file formats. On the flip side, if all your data is stored on a database, then for a machine learning workload to query the data, it involves spinning up two computes to query the data. Compute #1 would be your database engine (e.g. SQL server compute) to read data files and send the data back over the network, and Compute #2 (CPU or GPU optimized compute) for the machine learning workload to receive the data and then do further ML processing or prediction to the data. A lakehouse architecture can help to reduce the amount of compute resources required to perform a task.\n\nIn your situation, because you don't have a dedicated data engineer, I'd say to stick with what you know as that gets you to your desired outcomes. Your existing pattern works and your data volumes appear to be relatively small, and therefore you should only consider switching to a new architecture if:\n\n* Your data volumes are increasing at a rapid rate of growth (e.g. data volumes increasing by 10% per month).\n* You're not satisfied with the time it takes to process data (e.g. your queries take hours to run, and you want them completed in seconds or minutes).\n* Your company's desire for data insights is growing at a rapid rate (e.g. more data analysts or data scientists are being hired to build more data analytics and machine learning use-cases on top of the data).", "comment_Score": 1, "comment_Author": "j__neo", "comment_Link_id": "t3_1cb7mqe", "Create Date": "2024-04-23 23:39:12+00:00"}, {"comment_ID": "l0yu7n0", "comment_Body": "If the org follows standardization of performance using OKRs, KPIs or just general goals then you are evaluated against what you committed to.
